## About This Site

**Deteritus** is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast and flexible static site generator. The site uses a custom theme designed with a focus on typography and readability.

## Typography

The primary typeface is Iowan Old Style, a modern serif designed by John Downer. It draws inspiration from classic old-style typefaces while remaining highly legible on screens. Code is set in SF Mono.

## Design Principles

- **Minimalism**: Focus on content, not decoration
- **Readability**: Generous line height, comfortable measure
- **Performance**: No JavaScript frameworks, minimal dependencies
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, sufficient color contrast, respects system preferences

## Features

- Full-text search powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app)

- Multiple post types: articles, quotes, links, photos, and reviews
