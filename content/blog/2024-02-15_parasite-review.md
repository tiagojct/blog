Bong Joon-ho's Palme d'Or winner defies easy categorization. Is it a black comedy? A thriller? A social commentary? Yes to all, and somehow more than the sum of its parts.

The Kim family—clever, desperate, and endlessly inventive—scheme their way into employment with the wealthy Park family. What follows is a masterclass in tension, class dynamics, and architectural storytelling. The Parks' modernist home becomes a character itself, its clean lines hiding secrets beneath the surface.

Every frame is precisely composed, every scene building on the last. When the film pivots—and you'll know when—it transforms into something else entirely, yet feels inevitable in retrospect.

The final act lingers. Bong refuses easy answers, leaving us with questions about what it means to want, to have, and to lose.
