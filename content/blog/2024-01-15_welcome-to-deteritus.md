Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is where I share my thoughts on technology, music, books, films, and whatever else catches my attention.

I've always believed that writing helps clarify thinking. By putting thoughts into words, we're forced to organize them, question them, and sometimes discover that we didn't really understand something as well as we thought.

This blog is my attempt to do that in public. Not because I think my opinions are particularly valuable, but because the act of writing for an audience—even an imagined one—makes me more careful, more thoughtful.

So here we are. I hope you find something interesting here.
