Denis Villeneuve again (see my [Blade Runner 2049](/blade-runner-review/) review). Arrival is perhaps the best science fiction film of the last decade.

Based on Ted Chiang's "Story of Your Life," it's a film about language, time, and grief. Amy Adams delivers a career-defining performance as linguist Louise Banks.

The film's structure mirrors its themes in ways that only become clear on second viewing. It asks: if you knew how things would end, would you still choose to begin?

Like [Slaughterhouse-Five](/slaughterhouse-five-review/), it treats time as something fluid, something we experience rather than simply move through.
