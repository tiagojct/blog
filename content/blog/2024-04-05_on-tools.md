There's a tendency in tech culture to obsess over tools. The right text editor. The perfect note-taking app. The ultimate productivity system.

But tools are means, not ends. The carpenter isn't defined by their hammer.

I've written about [digital minimalism](/digital-minimalism/) and the importance of being intentional about technology. The same principle applies to creative tools: choose something that works, then get out of the way and do the work.

The best tool is often the one you already know. Mastery comes from use, not from switching to something new every few months.
