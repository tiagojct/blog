Cal Newport makes a compelling case for being more intentional about our technology use. This book pairs well with my earlier thoughts on [reading in the digital age](/on-reading/).

The core argument: our attention is valuable, and we should treat it as such. Rather than mindlessly adopting every new app and service, we should carefully curate our digital lives.

Newport's suggested 30-day digital declutter is challenging but worthwhile. The key isn't to abandon technology entirely, but to ensure that every tool we use provides clear value.
