Denis Villeneuve's sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 classic is a rare thing: a legacy sequel that justifies its existence. Like [Parasite](/parasite-review/), it uses genre conventions to explore deeper themes about humanity and identity.

Roger Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking—every frame could be hung in a gallery. The film moves slowly, deliberately, allowing its dystopian world to breathe.

Ryan Gosling's K is a different kind of protagonist than Harrison Ford's Deckard. Where Deckard questioned what he was hunting, K questions who he is. The film earns its nearly three-hour runtime.
