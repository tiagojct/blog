Welcome to my blog.
Yes, a "blog". An entity that defined an era of the Internet, back when the Internet was an escape from the life happening outside. In 2026, we're the opposite. We want real life to escape from the Internet.
Times are different, mainly because of us. The people. This mass that gathers around glowing rectangles, distracted, voluntarily or involuntarily.
I feel it too, the intense lure of the phone, of social media, of FOMO, of everything around us pulling our attention in an bottomless pit.
But I want to fight back. I remember the _old days_. The days where people just created stuff on the web, where you can find amazingly weird websites, made by regular people just trying to be funny, witty or just _escaping_. I remember it, and I miss it. And that´s why I created this.
I've tried to condense it to three points:
1. I want to produce something instead of just consuming. This applies to "content", but also, it should apply to almost everything in life I suppose (_mental note_);
2. This website is based on plain old text files. They should last forever (in theory);
3. Maybe the kids will want to read this someday. I'll write for them;

So, if you're reading this, say [hello](mailto:tiagojct@icloud.com)! And see you soon (hopefully).
