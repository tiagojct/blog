Aral Balkan articulates something I've been feeling for years: the web we have isn't the web we need.

The "Small Web" is his term for a more human-scale internet—one where individuals own their own spaces rather than renting them from corporations.

This connects to what I wrote about [rebuilding personal sites](/rebuilding-personal-sites/). There's value in having a corner of the internet that's truly yours.
