I know it's late January. I know it's 2026 already. But you know what? It's my blog, and I write when I want to, and above all, I write when I can. So here we go, my favorite albums of 2025. I may be missing some, but honestly, these are the ones that stood out the most to me.

### Testament - Para Bellum
They've still got it. A powerful release from an underappreciated thrash metal band that has continuously released good albums in their late career. This one is fast, meaty and full of social commentary: typical trash, but good trash.

### Tombs - Feral Darkness
Out of a dark abyss comes Tombs' latest album. There's no light here, only powerful metal.

### MASTIFF - For All the Dead Dreams
I've arrived way too late for the Mastiff party. I only discovered this blend of sludge and death metal with this EP, and what a discovery. Masterful, dirty riffs made me want to go through a wall.

### Bush - I Beat Loneliness
This album smells like acne, but I've enjoyed it. It reminded me of teenage heartaches, in a good way.

## Linda Martini - Passa-Montanhas
This Portuguese band manages to stay interesting and innovative. I was a devoted follower, but I lost interest for some years. However, this album has grown on me this year. I'm enjoying listening to them as they get older and still feel that punk attitude.

## Radiohead - Hail to the Thief (Live Recordings 2003-2009)
A live version of an underappreciated album. Extremely political, I jumped over it when it was released, coming from the seduction of Amnesiac, only to find out later that that was a terrible mistake. Hail to the Thief is full of wonderful, thoughtful songs, and this live recording is an excellent way to relive them. Additionally, it served as a warm-up for their European tour, for which I managed to secure tickets to a show in Madrid.

### Caustic Wound - Grinding Mechanisms of Torment
A discovery from a band I never heard of: praised be the day I've opened Angry Metal Guy, and this album showed up. It's so heavy that ENT doctors should advise against prolonged exposure.

### Wormrot - TNT
Grindcore was never really by style. I've come late to the Napalm Death wagon, and later still to the "core" ones. But Wormrot won me over simply by being a relentless trio that doesn't stop producing fast-paced tracks full of rage, blending so many different styles of heavy music. This album is a studio live recording celebrating the return of the original band members, and they sound amazing.

### Deafheaven - Lonely People With Power
I went to watch Myrkur that night back in 2016. She was opening for a band I've never heard of, Deafheaven. I was listening to her latest album, "M", and decided to attend one of her live shows. It sucked; the sound was bad, she seemed bored, I don't know, but something didn't click. I was thinking of living, but while waiting for a beer, Deafheaven started playing. It was mind-blowing—the energy, the charisma, the delivery. I didn't know a single song, and yet everything felt so familiar, as if it had been made just for me. They were touring "New Bermuda", and I got a signed CD, a souvenir that I relish with much care.  
I became a fan. Deafheaven's blend of styles, rooted in black metal, is right up my alley. They were not afraid to mix other genres, try new things, or evolve. I like that in a band. "Infinite Granite (2021)" was a more post-rock endeavour. I thought to myself that they were going the Mogwai way, which is not bad by itself, of course. Still, it felt like a lost opportunity to keep making interesting heavy metal.  
I was, fortunately, wrong. This album, "Lonely People With Power", is their best album, period. Better than "Sunbather", there, I said it. It features some of the most beautiful melodies they've produced, the most evolved lyrics, and the most compelling riffs. The production envelops you, and you can hear every instrument with clarity; that is something I genuinely appreciate.  
I don't know what the future holds for Deafheaven. If they break up tomorrow, they can rest assured that their place in heavy metal history is guaranteed. "Lonely People With Power" makes sure of that. Triumphant.

### Ghost - Skeletá
Tobias Forge created a Devil-fueled machine that continues to grow and produce interesting, hard rock / heavy metal / whatever you want to call it. 
It's a heartfelt homage to the 1980s music and sound; it's a conceptual album about love and relationships, it's fun, and it's something I'm grateful to have created. I feel a strong connection to Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Savatage, Black Sabbath, Europe, and everything in between. 
I don't have much more to say about this. Thanks, Tobias, it was worth the wait.
My kids love it, and my wife loves it; that's enough for me.

## Still haven't listened but will

Who has the time, right? But these are top priority.

### Nine Inch Nails - TRON: Ares (OST)
The soundtrack masters are back. I saw raving revies about this one. The single was quite good, so I expect great things.

### Mão Morta - Viva La Muerte
The Portuguese legends, an old favorite of mine, are still here, and still have a word or two to say.

### Deftones - private music
Everyone is crazy about this one. I don't what I feel for listening to Deftones in 2026, but weirder things have happened.

## Hoping for in 2026
### Soen - Reliance
My guess: They will exactly like Soen sounds.

### Converge - Love Is Not Enough
It. will. be. HEAVY.

### Bill Callahan - My Days of 58
I'll gladly go the mass of Father Bill.

### Gaerea - Loss
Yes, please, more. Moonspell opened the door, Gaerea are crossing it.
