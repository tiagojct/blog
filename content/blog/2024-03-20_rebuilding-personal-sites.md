I've rebuilt this site more times than I can count. Each iteration reflects where I am as a developer and writer.

Frank Chimero's essay on [The Web's Grain](/the-webs-grain/) has been influential in how I think about web design. The web isn't print. It's its own medium with its own strengths.

This current version prioritizes:

- **Readability** over flashiness
- **Longevity** over trends
- **Content** over chrome

Sometimes the best thing you can do for a personal site is to strip away everything that doesn't serve the writing.
