I've been thinking about how we read now versus how we used to read.

The shift isn't just about screens versus paper—though that's part of it. It's about attention, about the constant pull of notifications, about the subtle anxiety of knowing there's always something else demanding our attention.

When I sit down with a physical book, there's a different quality to the experience. The book asks nothing of me except to turn its pages. It won't buzz, won't update, won't suggest other books I might like. It's just there, patiently waiting.

This isn't nostalgia. I read plenty on screens, and I'm grateful for the access that provides. But I'm trying to be more intentional about creating space for the kind of deep reading that feels increasingly rare.

Maybe the medium matters less than the mindset. Maybe we can learn to read deeply anywhere, if we're willing to defend our attention.
