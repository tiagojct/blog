There's something about the golden hour that makes everything look better. The harsh edges of midday soften into something more forgiving.

I've been making an effort to take more walks lately, especially in the hour before sunset. It's become a small ritual—a way to transition from work mode to evening.

Like that earlier [morning photo](/morning-light/), these moments remind me to slow down.
