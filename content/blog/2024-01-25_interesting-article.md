Frank Chimero's essay on designing for the web as a medium with its own unique properties. Rather than fighting against the web's inherent flexibility, he argues we should embrace it.

The key insight: the web is not a fixed canvas but an edgeless surface. Designing for it means thinking in terms of systems and relationships rather than fixed layouts.

Required reading for anyone who works on the web.
